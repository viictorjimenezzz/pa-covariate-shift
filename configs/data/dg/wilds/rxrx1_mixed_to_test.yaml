# EVERY EXPERIMENT SHOULD CONTAIN ONLY ONE SAMPLE FROM EVERY CLASS.

# Variation of the OODtest for ERM baseline, in which 14 of the training experiments are replaced by
# the 14 test environment experiments but only for site 1 as well.
# The test size is thus reduced in half as we only test in site 2 now.
# I choose to substitute the training experiments 0-13 for convention.

transform:
  # Important to load the right transform for the data.
